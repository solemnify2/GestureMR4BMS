# Hand Gesture Controlled Mixed Reality for Falcon BMS

## Overview
This project utilizes a webcam to recognize hand gestures and control the Mixed Reality (MR) Cover for Falcon BMS. Using MediaPipe for hand tracking and `pynput` for simulating keyboard inputs, this program toggles the MR Cover in response to specific hand gestures.

## Features
- **Real-Time Hand Tracking**: Utilizes MediaPipe to detect and track hand movements in real-time.
- **Gesture Recognition**: Recognizes specific hand gestures to trigger actions.
- **MR Control**: Toggles the MR Cover in Falcon BMS based on recognized hand gestures.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- Pynput

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
